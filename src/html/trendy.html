                    QALF Infinity does not have hollow moments, and Dems manages to keep
                    the attention of his listener by changing the instrumentation in the
                    same track, as in "Passion". In this track, the rapper expresses 
                    himself on the different stages of his journey, his relationship
                    with Booba and his path to success.
                    Overall, this latest album shines by its richness. 
                    Damso has built his work by marking moments of lull
                    so that the storm becomes more explosive. Like the track
                    "Thevie Radio", which starts slowly and ends with an explosion
                    of kickage, before moving on to the banger that is "Zwaar".

                    On a deceptively calm instrumental, the piano blends with 
                    the intensity of his voice and leaves us speechless. 
                    The text is also full of meaning. Fianso offers us pointed references,
                    from Vincent Bollor√© to the English royal house of Windsor,
                    through Bonaparte and the American production company Metro Goldwyn.
                    In short, 3 minutes 15 of pure kick to discover.
