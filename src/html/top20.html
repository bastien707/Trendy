                "Butter" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BTS and released as a digital single on May 21,
                2021, through Big Hit Music and Sony Music Entertainment. It is the band's second English-language 
                single. A disco-pop, dance-pop, and EDM track, the song was written by Jenna Andrews, Robert Grimaldi,
                Stephen Kirk, RM, Alex Bilowitz, Sebastian Garcia, and Ron Perry, with production handled by Grimaldi
                , Kirk, and Perry.

                <br><br>Speaking on how "Butter" came about, Variety quoted RM in an interview with Apple Music as saying that
                "[the band] never expected to release another single, but the virus is getting longer and longer so we
                thought we need another summer song. We thought we needed another summer number, and Butter was
                perfectly fit for that. And now we're here". J-Hope said the recording process was "smooth" 
                and that the song "focus[ed] more on showing each of the members' charms compared with 'Dynamite'".

                <br><br>A psychedelic pop, pop rock, and art pop song, "Deja Vu" sees Rodrigo question a former lover, who is pursuing a
                different relationship, about his deja vu when he behaves with his new love-interest in the same manner he did with
                Rodrigo. The song received critical acclaim upon release. The accompanying music video is set in Malibu,

                "Montero (Call Me by Your Name)" (stylized as "MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)") is a song by American
                rapper and singer Lil Nas X. First previewed in a Super Bowl LV commercial in February 2021, the song
                was released on March 26, 2021, through Columbia Records. Written by Lil Nas X along with its producers,

                album Montero, which is expected for release in mid-2021.

                <br><br>The song is noted for its queer themes, including its sexually explicit homosexual lyrics, taking its name from the gay 
                romance novel and film Call Me by Your Name. While the song, music video, and associated promotion received positive reception 
                from some, they were also contentious among certain social critics in the United States, as they were deemed immoral or 
                harmful to children, particularly the Satan Shoes.

                <br><br>"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, giving Lil Nas X his second number-one hit on 
                the chart after "Old Town Road". It was also certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA on 22 April, 2021.
                Elsewhere, the song topped the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Israel, 
                Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten of the record charts in Belgium,
                Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

                "Drivers License" (stylized in all lowercase) is the debut single by American singer 
                and songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on January 8, 2021 as the lead single 
                from her debut studio album, Sour (2021), via Geffen and Interscope Records. She co-wrote 
                the song with its producer Dan Nigro. Containing poignant lyrics detailing heartache, 
                "Drivers License" is an atmospheric power ballad built around bedroom pop, indie pop, and power pop. It is characterized by a minimalist production incorporating kick drums, harmonies, syncopated hand-claps, and a dreamy bridge.

                it on January 4, 2021. The official music video was posted to YouTube alongside the 
                song's release, in which Rodrigo drives around a suburban area after receiving her 
                driver's license, and reminisces over her memories of the song's subject who encouraged 
                her to obtain the license. "Drivers License" was met with widespread critical acclaim; 
                praise centered on Rodrigo's cathartic songwriting, emotional vocals, and the song's 
                stirring production, with many underscoring its Taylor Swift and Lorde influences.

                On the aptly titled ‚Äútraitor,‚Äù Olivia Rodrigo reflects on what went wrong in a past relationship, the feeling of being betrayed, and still missing what she had. She follows the same ideas in some of her other songs, such as her January 2021 breakout hit, ‚Äúdrivers license,‚Äù and ‚Äúenough for you.‚Äù

                The piano-driven ballad went trending upon release, with many fans and the media speculating who the song was about and most of the suspects going to Joshua Bassett.

                The song's initial ballad version was written in 2016, but working on it 
                through the years it changed into a rock song. M√•neskin spoke of the 
                title as "referring to a cathartic anger, our anger transformed into something 
                positive, which leads to change things". As highlighted by critics, the lyrics 
                represent a criticism aimed at the generations of adults who do not understand and 
                do not value the young adults, who are invited by the quartet not to lower their 
                heads and to be the truest version of themselves. According to NME, "lyrically, 
                the song deals in themes of 'challenging prejudices' and 'finding redemption' ‚Äì 
                ideas that lay at the core of M√•neskin and their overall message". As described 
                at Wiwibloggs, it "is a manifesto for those who want to move forward by treasuring 
                their uniqueness. Never mind who's talking (without knowing what they're saying)".
                On 7 May 2021, an acoustic version of the song was uploaded on YouTube.

                "Levitating" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album, 
                Future Nostalgia (2020). The song was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr., Sarah Hudson 
                and Stephen Kozmeniuk, with the image of Mike Myers in Austin Powers in mind. The production 
                was handled by Koz and Stuart Price, and stemmed from a Roland VP-330 synthesizer sample 
                played by the former. The song is an electro-disco and nu-disco song with several disco tropes. 
                It incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop-funk, power pop and space rock, as well as 1970s, 
                1980s and 1990s pop and R&B styles. The lyrics describe the idea of "levitating" when falling in love,
                with several outer space references.
                <br><br>
                A remix of "Levitating" featuring American rapper DaBaby was released on 1 October 2020 as the album's 
                fifth single globally, and third in the United States. It impacted contemporary hit radio formats on 6 
                October 2020. The remix has the same production used in the original, with DaBaby adding a pop rap verse and intro. 
                "Levitating" reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart and number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lipa's seventh 
                top 5 single in the UK and second in the US. It also reached number 3 on the Billboard Global 200 chart. The song was 
                awarded a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

                ‚Äúenough for you‚Äù is the seventh track on Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs debut album SOUR. 
                Olivia describes the extra effort she put in to try to be enough for her lover, 
                comparing herself to her love‚Äôs exes, just for her lover to leave her for someone else. 
                She‚Äôs left feeling heartbroken, but knows that in the end, her lover will be the heartbroken one.
                
                <br><br>OLIVIA RODRIGO via YouTube RELEASED :
                I wrote ‚Äúenough for you‚Äù entirely by myself which I‚Äôm very proud of. 
                I wrote it literally on my bedroom floor. I actually was on ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù TikTok for a while, 
                which is really funny. I was literally scrolling through TikTok and I found this really 
                hopeful breakup video. It‚Äôs so embarrassing that this inspired this really emotional song, 
                but I really was very inspired by this TikTok.

                In ‚Äúhappier,‚Äù Olivia wishes the best for an ex-lover and their new relationship, but simultaneously
                 hopes to remain a significant memory in their life.
                <br>
                The whole album of SOUR centers on the loss of a lover, in Rodrigo‚Äôs case losing Joshua Bassett to Sabrina Carpenter.
                From the scathing ‚Äúgood 4 u,‚Äù to the bitter ‚Äúdeja vu,‚Äù headed up by the heartbreaking ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù the album is full of songs allegedly directed at Bassett, revealing Rodrigo‚Äôs heartbreak in him leaving her. By the eighth track, Rodrigo starts to accept the fact that even though she wants him back it is doubtful it will happen. Rodrigo wants him to know that even though she is letting him go, she wants him to remember that she was the best he could ever get.
                <br>
                Olivia first teased the song on Instagram on January 13, 2020, by posting an acoustic snippet with the caption: 
                ‚Äúshe do be writing doe. ‚Äòhappier‚Äô by me!‚Äù

                ‚Äú1 step forward, 3 steps back‚Äù is about the ups and downs of life and the challenge of 
                navigating relationships with an inconsistent partner, as every time Olivia takes a step 
                forward towards meeting her true love, she immediately feels pushed back from her goals.

                The song contains a slight interpolation of Taylor Swift‚Äôs 2017 track ‚ÄúNew Year‚Äôs Day,‚Äù while bearing some 
                similarities in its main concept from another song by Swift, ‚ÄúDear John" (2010).

                Rodrigo has praised Swift several times, citing her not only as a heavy inspiration for her introspective 
                songwriting and melodies, but also as a role model in the music industry, as she told Nylon Magazine:

                Obviously, I think she‚Äôs the best songwriter of all time, but she‚Äôs so business-savvy and she really cares 
                about her career in that regard, too. That‚Äôs been really inspiring for me to watch somebody take control of her career life like that.

                The song was originally released through Teamwrk Records on 7 June 2019, initially achieving minor success 
                within Australia but also becoming Masked Wolf's most popular single at the time. However, in late 2020, 
                the track started to gain more attention on social media and was being used in a variety of social media clips 
                such as those on TikTok. To further propel the release, he was signed by Elektra Records in early 2021, with the 
                song being re-released on 6 January 2021. By that time, the song had already reached more than 32 million 
                streams on Spotify and was steadily gaining more traction through social media and clips on TikTok. In February 
                2021, it surpassed the 100 million Spotify streams mark, becoming Teamwrk Records' most streamed track, ahead of 
                Tyron Hapi's "Anyway" featuring Mimoza; however, Hapi was the producer for "Astronaut in the Ocean", thus 
                further imprinting him into the success of the label's releases. The song was also included in the playlist 
                "The Shazam Predictions 2021", compiled by Shazam and Apple Music. About the lyrics, the rapper revealed: 
                "'Astronaut In The Ocean' touches on mental depression, how I was stuck in a place of anxiety and feeling low."
                During the song, the rapper provides insight into his mental state.

                "Leave the Door Open" is the debut single by the American super-duo Silk Sonic, 
                consisting of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak. It was released on March 5, 2021 by Aftermath 
                Entertainment and Atlantic Records as the lead single from Silk Sonic's upcoming debut studio album 
                An Evening with Silk Sonic. "Leave the Door Open" was written by Mars, Brandon Anderson, Dernst 
                Emile II and Christopher Brody Brown, while the production was handled by Mars and D'Mile. "Leave 
                the Door Open" is an R&B and soul song, influenced by quiet storm and inspired by the "1970s 
                Philadelphia soul" groups. Its romantic lyrics describe a "detailed erotic invitation".
                <br><br>
                "Leave the Door Open" received critical acclaim, with some praising both singers' vocals, as well as the song's 
                composition. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one in various charts, including the US Billboard 
                Hot 100, Israel, Malaysia and New Zealand. It has also entered the top ten of several countries, such as Australia, 
                Belgium, Canada and Portugal, as well as the top twenty of Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. 
                It has been certified platinum by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and Music Canada (MC).
                <br><br>
                The accompanying music video, which was directed by Florent Dechard and Mars, was released 
                along with the song. It depicts Mars and Paak, as Silk Sonic, performing the song in a vintage studio as several 
                women dance to it. To promote "Leave the Door Open", Mars and Paak performed it at the 63rd Annual 
                Grammy Awards, which received praise for its simplicity and was compared to a 70's Soul Train telecast. 
                A stripped version of the song with some fan interaction was also performed at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music 
                Awards. An emote for the online video game Fortnite was also created, which features dance moves by Mars 
                played along the chorus of the song.

                ‚Äújealousy, jealousy‚Äù is about the unrealistic standards society has set for young people, 
                most notably young women, in the latest years.

                Olivia sings about her personal experience, as she constantly tries to fight the feeling of 
                comparing herself to other girls and jealousy that comes with it, as well as the self-shaming 
                behavior that social media can often lead to.
                <br><br>
                Olivia Rodrigo via Nylong :
                [‚Äújealousy, jealousy‚Äù] was one of the first songs that I wrote on the record with this wonderful 
                writer named Casey Smith. In this time period, I was super obsessed with social media. I would look for 
                things that would hurt my feelings all the time and compare myself to everyone. I felt like my life was 
                only what I showed to others. I didn‚Äôt feel like my life was any deeper than my Instagram feed. That‚Äôs a 
                really troubling mindset to be in as a teenager. And so I guess I wanted to write a song about that. It 
                isn‚Äôt sad or ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm enough,‚Äù it‚Äôs "Oh, God, I‚Äôm so jealous.‚Äù It‚Äôs tongue-in-cheek, and 
                a little funny to me. But the sonics on the song are the reason why we put it on the record. There‚Äôs this 
                piano in the bridge that‚Äôs so convoluted and almost atonal. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt go with the music and 
                it‚Äôs so chaotic.

                In the song ‚Äúfavorite crime‚Äù, the 10th track of her debut album SOUR, Olivia Rodrigo displays her 
                lyricism by subverting the situation she‚Äôs in. As she implies that she is partly responsible for 
                her heartbreak because she let herself be treated badly in the relationship, she starts the process of moving on.
                In the Sour Diary ‚ÄúJournal / Zine‚Äù Olivia wrote >‚ÄúDan & I wrote Favorite Crime sometime last summer

                awhile & it sort of sparked the entire song. I really love how the song is one big metaphor. 
                Figurative language was something I had to work on in my song writing. I‚Äôm a very literal, 
                specific writer & metaphors & similes aren‚Äôt often where my brain tends to go, so I‚Äôm super
