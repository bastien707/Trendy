                "Good 4 U" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by American singer and
                songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on May 14, 2021, through Geffen and Interscope Records,
                as the third single from Rodrigo's debut studio album Sour, which was released on May 21, 2021.
                The song was announced on May 10 via Rodrigo's social media. It was written by Rodrigo and its
                producer Daniel Nigro.

                <br><br>A song blending pop punk, pop rock, grunge, and teen pop, "Good 4 U" is set to electric guitars and drums,
                with lyrics addressing a former lover who moved on very quickly after a breakup. It received positive
                reviews from music critics, who found the instrumentation nostalgic of the 1990s‚Äì2000s and praised
                Rodrigo's crisp songwriting. The accompanying music video features Rodrigo as a cheerleader setting out
                for revenge, visually alluding to the 2000s' cult classic films Princess Diaries and Jennifer's Body.
